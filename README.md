# Blockhit Fix (1.8)
Bukkit 1.8.8 plugin that aims to fix the blockhit glitch, caused when a player opens an inventory while blocking.

I found this bug while playing on 1.8 pvp servers, if you manage to open an inventory while blocking with your sword, your blocking state won't go away after closing the inventory.

This can easily be abused in pvp gamemodes, hence this plugin was created.
